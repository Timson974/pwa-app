PWA APP for Noise, Vibration Risk Analysis
The project focuses on how risk value affects the productivity of IT users

The project areas are the Library levels 1,2,3, the Printing area, Street, others

During the project development the PWA, quantitative risk analysis (QRA) and

qualitative factor risk analysis (QFRA) were developed for UWL facilities
The project methodology is the Prototyping, Waterfall and Risk assessment

The development method is a risk value calculation, where probability and impact

The method for PWA development is React.js
Tools for the measurement were chosen as a Noise meter and Vibration meter

The developed sensor based on analysing and visualizing sound data

The measured data compared with OHS standards for offices and promises
The personal protective equipment was recommended for decrease noise impact

Isolation of noise and vibration materials were advised to avoid vibration impact

To increase the distance from the source of noise and vibration exposure were advised
